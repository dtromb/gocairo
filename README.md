# gocairo

---

###gocairo will be a complete binding of the excellent [libcairo](https://www.cairographics.org) 2d graphics library.

It provides subpixel-resolution graphics primitives, can output to a variety of targets cross-platform,
and with it you can create PDFs, images, SVG graphics, or application client graphics using a standard
interface.

See the [libcairo manual](https://www.cairographics.org/manual) for documentation and have a look at
the [samples](https://github.com/dtromb/gocairo/tree/master/samples) to get a feel for how the API conventions
work.

A lot of functionality is already implemented and usable now.  See the [TODO](https://github.com/dtromb/gocairo/tree/master/TODO.md) for a list of what's missing.
